        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p class="text-blk subHeading"> Hi, I'm Chitaha, a data consultant with a passion for using data to make a positive difference. I know that making sense of data can be tough, especially for organizations led by women, LGBTQ+ communities, Indigenous groups, and other marginalized voices. Each of these organizations has a unique story and mission, and sometimes the data can feel like a puzzle that just doesn't fit. </p>
        <p class="text-blk subHeading"> The Problem: It can be overwhelming to navigate the world of data. Without the right tools and insights, important information can get lost, making it harder to achieve your goals and create the impact you want. Many organizations don't realize how much potential their data holds or how it can be used to drive their mission forward. </p>
        <p class="text-blk subHeading"> The Solution: That's where I come in. I’m here to help you unlock the potential of your data. By tailoring data tools and insights to fit your specific needs, I can help you turn that puzzle into a clear picture. Whether you're looking to understand your audience better, measure the impact of your programs, or make data-driven decisions, I can provide the support you need. </p>
        <p class="text-blk subHeading"> Why Work With Me? I believe in the power of data to tell stories and drive change. My approach is not just about numbers; it's about understanding your unique context and goals. I work closely with you to ensure that the data solutions we develop are meaningful and actionable. Together, we can make sure your data works for you, helping you to achieve your mission and make a lasting impact. </p>
        <p class="text-blk subHeading"> Who Can Benefit? If you're part of an organization that feels overwhelmed by data or unsure how to use it effectively, my services are for you. Whether you're a small nonprofit, a community group, or a larger organization, I can help you harness the power of your data to create real, lasting change. </p>
